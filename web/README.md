Ecomm Web (SPA)

A modern, responsive single-page e-commerce frontend built with React + TypeScript + Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, data-fetched with TanStack Query, form-validated with Zod + React Hook Form, and client state via Zustand.

This app talks to the backend at http://localhost:8080/api (configurable), supports JWT auth (HttpOnly cookie), and a guest/user cart that persists using a stable X-Cart-Id.

‚ú® Features

Home / Landing with hero, categories, featured picks

Auth: Signup & Login (JWT cookie), /auth/me hydration on app load

Catalog: /items with search, category filter, price range, sorting, and pagination (URL-driven)

Cart: /cart with quantity stepper, remove, clear, and live subtotal

Guest cart is persisted by a UUID in localStorage sent as X-Cart-Id

Logged-in users use a server cart keyed by userId

Navbar with live cart count and login/logout actions

Production-ready UX: loading & error states, optimistic cues like ‚ÄúAdded ‚úì‚Äù

Authentication Flow

Signup ‚Üí POST /auth/signup returns { user } and may set a cookie on login only.

Login ‚Üí POST /auth/login sets a HttpOnly JWT cookie.

Hydrate on load ‚Üí App calls /auth/me to restore the user.

Logout ‚Üí POST /auth/logout clears cookie; navbar updates.

Cookies are HttpOnly; there is no token in localStorage.

üõí Cart Behavior

Guest cart

web/src/store/cart.ts creates/persists a UUID in localStorage (cartId)

Axios interceptor attaches X-Cart-Id on every request

Server uses this id to load/persist a guest cart

Logged-in cart

Server keys by userId from the JWT cookie

The same UI works without changes

Navbar badge uses useQuery(["cart"]) to show the total quantity
